Founded in 2017, Blockchain Society at the University of Washington is a student non-profit organization focused on facilitating blockchain education and adoption, fostering the next generation of blockchain innovators, and advancing our students to the professional industry through collaboration, multidisciplinary, and networking opportunities in the PNW region and beyond.

At our club, we occasionally host speakers networking events and general member meetups.

We have a track record of club student project initiatives and developments:

2023: UW Blockchain Research Cohort (May), EthAcademia (August)

2022: Case Hack Competition (Hackathon); 70+ participants and $10k prize pool

2020: Hash Code (Hackathon); 100+ participants and $1,500 prize pool

2018: UW Blockchain Expo; raised $45k and sold 630+ tickets

In the coming years, we are dedicated to continue hosting our annual Case Hack and EthAcademic (previously Blockchain Expo 2018), serving blockchain community members on our campus and throughout the pacific north region. With EthAcademia being our spotlight event, providing a valuable platform for the blockchain community to come together and share knowledge, network, and collaborate on innovative ideas.

One of our other goals is to provide our students opportunities beyond the boundaries of our campus. We traveled across the states going to Denver, SF, Texas, NYC and much more to attend conferences, host hackathons, build connections and foster community and relationships for our students. With this track record, our goal is to bring our students to travel more (even internationally!) in the coming years to gain more exposure to the industry, innovations, and opportunities!
